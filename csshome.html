	<h2> Highly rated luxury car in the World </h2>
		<p> 2023 Mercedes-Benz S-Class: At The Top Of The Heap. Technically, Mercedes-Benz now offers two different luxury sedan flagships. The all-electric EQS has gotten more attention for the past year, but the traditional S-Class is still the same luxury limousine leader it’s always been. Though the S-Class concept was created in 1954, the name was first formally applied in 1985. There have been seven generations in total, all among the best of the best in their eras, and the 2023 version doesn’t let any of its predecessors down. It offers two models, both offering impressive standard power, tech features and sumptuous luxury.</p>

	<h3> First car insight you may want to read </h3>
		<p> While it's important to choose a vehicle that's affordable to buy and insure, a first car should also fit the driver's wants if possible. For basic all-around transportation, vehicles like the Toyota RAV4 and Honda CR-V can be had for good prices and shouldn't be too hard to insure, and they offer immense practicality, reliability, and decent gas mileage. For more fun and savings with a little less interior space, the Honda Fit has proven to be an excellent all-around vehicle, featuring dynamics good enough to start in its own amateur racing series and enough practicality to make for a perfect daily driver. Finally, if one is serious about fun on a budget, you can't do better than the first two generations of the Mazda Demio. </p>
