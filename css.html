    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <p>Financial Analyst|First National Bank| January 2018-May 2024</p>
    <p> As I was quite new in the industry of banking, most work was analyzing bank statements that had already been released. Later on, 2020, the workload began as I had completed my banking course and was now able to do bank statements, analyze, compare, balance and submit. All this hard work and dedication got me promoted to a higher sector.
